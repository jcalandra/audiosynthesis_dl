<p><strong>Problematc :</strong><br>
Difficulties to reproduce analogic sounds.<br>
In this article the researchers tries to reproduce the effects from the Fender Bassman 56F-A vacuum-tube amplifier.</p>
<p>Two main approaches to virtual analog modeling :</p>
<ul>
<li>white-box modeling : circuit analysis and simulation (wave digital filters WDF) --&gt; high degree of accuracy</li>
<li>black-box modeling : based on input-output measurements of the device under study --&gt; general, less accurate, does not include oftenly user control.</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea in this paper is to overcome the limitations of a conventional black-box by using a deep neural network</p>

<p>This Neural Network is a variant of the WaveNet depp neural Network + SPICE model of the tube amplifier.</p>
<p><strong>WaveNet architecture :</strong><br>
2 main parts : a stack of dilated causal convolution layers (nonlinear filter bank) where the output of each conv layer is used as input to a fully connected post-processing module (fully-connected neural  network.</p>
