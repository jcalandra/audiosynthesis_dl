# audiosynthesis_dl
Github created in the context of End of Studies internship about Sound synthesis and Sound modification using Deep Learning.

## Description of the internship

This internship is about doing a state of the art about the various methods of music synthesis, based on neural networks. Then, new methods will be proposed to synthesize or transform sounds. The applications will be synthesis or transformation of instrumental sound, aiming to help for musical composition.

## Organisation of the project

The folder is organised in the following way :

- **doc** is a folder containing all the definitions, link and description of articles that are read and studied for this project. it contains the following documents :
  - **articles** : contains the resume of the articles that has been read.
  - **definitions** : contains a few definitions about key words.
  - **references** : list all the references used in this project.
  
- **test** contains the already existing code that has been tested. It contains the following folders :
  - **wavenet**: The neural network NSynth developped by google has been tested
  - **tacotron** ?
  - **SampleRNN** ?
  
- **data** contains a few data necessary to test the different neural networks.
